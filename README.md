This is a my portfolio.  My relevant experience is highlighted for potential employers to view.  Included is a my bio, coding projects, skills, and contact details.  Also contained is a link to my most current resume.

## Design
* The application uses the Bootstrap framework in a _HTML single-page_ design.
    * A vertical Navbar is used for navigation in a fixed position on the left.
    * The Navbar contains buttons that are linked to the information rendered:
        * The About page provides a short bio.
        * The Projects page provides a list of projects I have built.
        * Each project contains a link to the readme file, a link to run the application, and a link to the code.
        * The Skills page contains a list of my skills to include both Web Development and Software Testing.
        * The Contact page contains links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn account.
        * The Resume button redirects the user to my Google document resume.
    * JavaScript provides a snazzy _smooth-scrolling_ effect to bring the information into view.
    * The Media query style sheet method is used to reposition the vertical Navbar to the top for small-screen mobile device rendering.

* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * Bootstrap -- Responsive Front-end framework
    * HTML and CSS -- Provides the means to create structured documents with style
    * JavaScript -- Provides smooth scrolling to the various code blocks on the single HTML page
    * Media Query -- Provides rendering to smaller mobile devices

## What the project does
* The application provides a bio, project portfolio, skill set, and contact details to interested employers.
* The application provides a link to my resume and work-history, also to those interested.

## Challenges
* Several solutions to a fixed Navbar were tried before one was selected as it proved to be reliable.
* Setting up the smooth scrolling effect worked well once the JavaScript code was right.
