This is a front-end application that highlights my skills and work history to potential employers. 

## Design
* The application uses the Bootstrap framework in a single-page approach design.
    * A fixed vertical Navbar using Bootstrap is included for navigation.
    * The Navbar contains buttons with HTML tags that are linked to the information on the page.
    * HTML tags and JavaScript provide a smooth scrolling effect to bring the information into view.
    * Used media query to move the vertical Navbar to the top for mobile device rendering.

* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * Bootstrap -- Responsive Front-end framework
    * HTML and CSS -- Provides the means to create structured documents with style
    * JavaScript -- Provides smooth scrolling to the various HTML blocks on the page

## What the project does
* The application provides a bio, project portfolio, skill set, and contact details to interested employers.
* The application also provides a link to my resume and work-history, also to those interested.

## Challenges
* Several solutions to a fixed Navbar were tried before one was selected as it proved to be reliable.
* Setting up the smooth scrolling effect worked well once the JavaScript code was right.
