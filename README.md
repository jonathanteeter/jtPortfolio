# jtPortfolio
This is a my portfolio, that highlights relevant experience to potential employers.  Included is a my bio, coding projects, skill list, and contact details.  Also contained is a link to my most current resume.

## Design
* The application uses the Bootstrap framework in a _single-page_ design.
    * A fixed vertical Navbar is used for navigation.
    * The Navbar contains buttons that are linked to the various page indexes:
        * #index, #about, #projects, and #contact contained in the index.html file
        * #resume that redirects to a Google document
    * JavaScript provides a _smooth-scrolling_ effect to bring the information into view.
    * Media query is used to move the vertical Navbar to the top for small-screen mobile device rendering.

* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * Bootstrap -- Responsive Front-end framework
    * HTML and CSS -- Provides the means to create structured documents with style
    * JavaScript -- Provides smooth scrolling to the various HTML blocks on the page

## What the project does
* The application provides a bio, project portfolio, skill set, and contact details to interested employers.
* The application also provides a link to my resume and work-history, also to those interested.

## Challenges
* Several solutions to a fixed Navbar were tried before one was selected as it proved to be reliable.
* Setting up the smooth scrolling effect worked well once the JavaScript code was right.
